    <p>
      <b> tldr; </b> After graduating with a B.S. in Mathematics, I transitioned
      into software development by attending App Academy as a full-time software
      engineering student. I'm currently trying to find my niche, but I really
      enjoy designing, automation & testing, and the ethereum blockchain as of
      right now.

    Use storyLinks later when I figured out how to nest pages!
